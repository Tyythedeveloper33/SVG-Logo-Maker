  ## Description  
      The Fast Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows users to quickly generate well-structured Logo.svg file for their project. Creating a Logo.svg is the file that users can open up on a server to see the generated logo that came from answering command-line prompt questions . 


      - GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
      - WHEN user is prompted for text, THEN user can enter up to three characters
      - WHEN user is prompted for the text color, THEN user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
      - WHEN user is prompted for a shape, THEN user is presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
      - WHEN user prompted for the shape's color, THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
      - WHEN user has entered input for all the prompts, THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
      AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
      - WHEN user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser, THEN user is shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
